A High Intensity Focused Ultrasound Simulator implemented using
NVIDIA's Compute Unified Device Architecture

Author: Adam Pan

1. Building

    Requirements:
        - CUDA enabled graphics card (Compute 2.0)
        - NVIDIA developer drivers
        - CUDA Toolkit 3.0
        - gcc 4.0+

    To compile the program, use "make".
    The binary is located in "/bin/[platform]/release/"

2. Usage

    The program requires a configuration file to specify the simulation 
    parameters. A few preconstructed configuration files can be found in 
    "/confs/".

    Example:	bubbles confs/Sample.txt

    The program outputs the results as plain-text tuples into "/results/".

    I've also added some form of automation using shell scripts:

        plot_results.sh [x-dimensions, y-dimensions, x-pixels, y-pixels]

            plots data outputted by the program, and stores them in
            "/images/".

        executor.sh [ConfName]

            The script looks in the "/confs/" directory for a series of
            configuration files matching "ConfName_x.txt", where x is any
            integer. It then runs through all the configuration files,
            storing the results (as well as plots) in timestamped folders in
            "/data/".

3. Notes

    The program is threadsafe, and does not interfere with the operation of
    CPU bound applications. In addition, multiple instances of the program
    may be launched on the same graphics card.
